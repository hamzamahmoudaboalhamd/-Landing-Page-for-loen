## ‚ú® Project Overview

The **Leon Landing Page** is a dedicated front-end project representing the classic, clean design aesthetic of the "Leon" template. This one-page site is designed as a professional showcase for creative services, focusing on delivering content with **clarity and elegance**.

The primary objective of this project was to demonstrate absolute mastery of **HTML structure and native CSS layout techniques** (Pure CSS) for building a multi-section, fully responsive website without relying on JavaScript or external frameworks.

### Key Sections Implemented:

* **Header & Navigation:** Includes the logo and main menu links.
* **Services:** Grid-based presentation of the agency's offerings.
* **Portfolio (Work):** A gallery section to display projects.
* **About & Contact:** Final sections for business information and communication.

## üõ†Ô∏è Code Structure and Technical Breakdown

This project's strength lies in its predictable and highly readable file structure, which ensures easy scalability and maintenance.

### 1. Code Functionality (The CSS Core)

| File | Primary Function | Technical Skill Demonstrated |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`leon.css`** | **Aesthetic & Layout:** Contains all custom rules, colors, and typography, defining the unique "Leon" look. | Strong command of **CSS Layout** techniques (Flexbox) and the use of **CSS Custom Properties (Variables)** for reusable design elements. |
| **`index.html`** | **Structure:** Includes special headings (`<div class="special-heading">`) that often utilize CSS **Pseudo-elements (`::before`, `::after`)** in `leon.css` for decorative lines and unique text styling. | **Efficient Class Naming** and **Semantic Structure** for better content organization. |

### 2. Professional Standards

* **Pure CSS:** No reliance on heavy frameworks like Bootstrap, minimizing file size and maximizing performance.
* **Cross-Browser Support:** Ensured by including the dedicated **`normalize.css`** file.
* **High Readability:** The structure is clean and logically ordered, a standard requirement in collaborative development environments.
